Intro
-----
There is a need to improve and promote the pharmacistâ€™s role in oral chemotherapy medication management, 
and this prompted our chemotherapy medication safety initiative. This eHealth project is an example of 
passive decision support system development. Interactivity with the data is limited to hyperlinks to static 
pages of information. Nevertheless, by providing a unified view on multiple data sources in a one-pager and 
providing this in a context-specific environment, namely Canadian non-oncology trained pharmacists, our web-based 
data repository aims to enable safer dispensing of oral-chemotherapeutics.
